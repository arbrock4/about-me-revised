      App Pitch
<br>
      My app is called GDFinds and its an App/site to help gamers find local game events, tournaments, meetups, and deals at game stores.
<br>
      The Problem we look to address is for gamers to find the deals they want itâ€™s a hard-long slog of searching either over the internet or on foot. I want to provide just one singular place they can search to find all the information they need. This would also in turn help the game stores themselves as making gamers aware of deals at lesser known game stores should easily increase their traffic. This app is for alerting users of deals at any game store regardless of main stream appeal the store might have.
<br>
      Our main demographic are Gamers who may be looking for better deals related to the games they play and who want to be more aware of things happening related to their hobby around them. As well as game stores that are looking to drag in more potential customers.
<br>
      What we do primarily is make detailed, web based, info pages about any events, tournaments, meetups, and deals a certain store were advertising for is having on our site. In addition, we will, as it is commonly called, signal boost this information we provide on any social media site we can manage to get this information on which will link back to our own site/app. Ie. Twitter, facebook, boosting youtube videos if the meetup holders make them, and others. We would also of course provide directions to the location the event, tournament, meetup, or deal is being held at and possibly link the website of the store holding the meetup.
<br>
      As an example of the signal boosting part of the service if the store were to make a video about their event or sale we would on social media say something like, hey check out this video about this cool gaming meetup/deal in this such and such place.
<br>
      We will stay afloat with revenue form of course advertisers, we will ask for a cut of any profits made during a event or sale we advertise, and a premium version of the app for users which when paid for will give them access to a larger list of deals and events and more exclusive events. Also offer premiums to stores that if they pay a fee well make the app advertise them more often than others on the app.
<br>
      As for competitors the closets vie found are, as I alluded to earlier, services that advertise esports level events and also a site called yelp which would be our major competitor. Even though yelp seems like our direct competitor I believe we would still have a chance at a successful service. Our direct focus on gaming scenes in the city unlike yelp's focus on any kind of get together or deal all over the world may help us differentiate cause for gamers to find the kind of meetups their looking for they would not have to sort through millions of other events just to find that one gaming tournament or deal happening a few blocks near them.
